# Data Science Articles

Welcome to the "Data Science Articles" repository!

## Introduction

In today's world, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a trending topic. However, many individuals struggle to grasp the underlying principles and mathematical concepts. A solid understanding of statistics, probability, linear algebra, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) is crucial before diving into AI.

Throughout my learning journey, I encountered numerous challenges in comprehending AI. Most online resources offer only abstract or surface-level explanations, which can be frustrating for those seeking to learn the core principles. My goal is to bridge this gap by contributing to the data science community through articles that present mathematical intuition in a simple and accessible manner.

## Purpose

This repository aims to provide in-depth articles on various data science topics, including but not limited to:

- Statistics
- Probability
- Linear Algebra
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Each article is crafted with the intent to simplify complex concepts and provide a clear understanding.
